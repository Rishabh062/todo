## Todo App

A very begineer friendly **todo app** build using **React JS** and **CSS**.
## How to run the project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Check the website --> It is Live.

### Project is missing major updates, as it is a totally bootstrapped. I will generate more updates in near time.

#### This repo is open for valid pull requests, if you want to make some changes, then go for it.
